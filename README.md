# MEP-appendix
Appendix with programs and data used in the project
## ard_control_base

Example of basic arsuino stepper motor script

## ard_control

Advanced arduino controlscript that recieves signals from python and moves the right motor in the right direction

## Arduino_control

Python script for sending singals to VICI valves and aruino boards

## For users

Python script that is most usable for testing what the code does for yourself, commented clearly

## Usable_program_real

Needed for the "For users" document to work

##new curve fit strat

Base script for fitting systems of ODE's to data

## Full workflow sim true comparison adaptable fits & Full workflow sim true comparison adaptable

Programs used to collect data on fit guess reliability as a function of data quality, sparse comments

## Multireactor pressure readings & Multireactor pressure readings_run2

Python scripts for handling and fitting real reactor data

## excel sheets
2 sheets are raw and processed reactor run data, 1 sheet is the raw data used for figures on data quality dependency of guesses
